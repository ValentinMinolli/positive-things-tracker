# My Positive Things Tracker App:

Welcome to my Positive Things Tracker App! This application allows you to register and keep track of five positive things that happened to you each day. The main goal is to highlight the small and positive experiences that occur in your daily life and promote awareness of them.

## Features

The application offers the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: Before starting to use the application, you need to authenticate yourself as a user. This ensures the privacy and security of your positive things records.

2. **Daily Registration of Five Positive Things**: Once authenticated, you can enter five distinct positive things that happened to you during the day. It's important to make sure that each positive thing is unique and not repeated in subsequent days.

3. **Daily Storage**: The five positive things you enter will be stored for the corresponding day. This allows you to review your records on previous days and track your progress over time.

4. **Different Levels of Complexity**: The application offers different levels of complexity to suit your preferences and challenge your ability to find new positive things.
   
   - **Beginner Level**: Allows repetition of positive things.
   - **Intermediate Level**: Does not allow repetition of positive things until one month has passed.
   - **Advanced Level**: Does not allow repetition of positive things for a period of three months.

5. **Positive Things History**: In the Intermediate and Advanced levels, positive things entered in previous months will be stored as a history. This allows you to review and reflect on all the positive things you have experienced over time.

6. **Change Complexity Level**: You have the option to change your complexity level at any time. If you decide to change, you will start from scratch with the newly selected level.
